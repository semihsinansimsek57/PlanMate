Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). Here are a few general guidelines:

* Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
* I welcome Issues for tasks of all size. If you're unsure if a change is "too small" to warrant an Issue, just go ahead and create one.

* When creating PRs, make sure an Issue exists for the task that you're tackling.
